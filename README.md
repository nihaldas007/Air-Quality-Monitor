# Air-Quality-Monitor
This project is an Air Quality Monitoring System that utilizes a TFT touchscreen display to provide real-time environmental data. The system measures key air quality parameters, including PM2.5, CO2 levels, gas concentration, temperature, and humidity, and visually represents the data on a MCUFRIEND TFT screen using graphical elements.
